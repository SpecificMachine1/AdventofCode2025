# Advent of Code 2025

- trying r6rs this year using Chez scheme
- haven't really looked at r6rs libraries, I know the record
  system is different since it doesn't rely on syntax rules
- not sure how much I will try to use syntax-case, but am
   going to look at other features
- may or may not try benchmarking various implementations, still
  undecided at this point
